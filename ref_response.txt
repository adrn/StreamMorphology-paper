Summary. This is a thorough investigation of the effect (and its origins) of orbital chaos in a static triaxial potential on the morphology of debris distributions originating from tidal disruption of satellites. The manuscript is quite long (and hence tiring to read) and suffers from some amount of inconsistent/unfortunate/sloppy terminology and methodology. I anticipate that it will be ready for publication after revision.

To speed-up reviewing a revised version, I suggest the authors colour code any alterations made at revision and place the figures with the associated text.


main comments:

One problematic and confusing issue is the implied meaning of the term "orbit" as used by the authors. AFAIK, an orbit is defined as the ensemble of all points on a trajectory as it is followed **ad infinitum**. Defined in this way, an orbit doesn't "evolve" (for a static potential). The author's usage of "orbit" is inconsistent with this common definition, yet they fail to provide an alternative. Perhaps they mean a "trajectory followed over many (but finite) dynamical times" or "over a Gyr" or "over a Hubble time"? For stellar dynamics, such objects are certainly useful and can definitely evolve ... but aren't orbits.

>>> We ...

What is more, the stochastic trajectories are only restricted by the conservation of orbital energy and the existence of regular orbits. Thus, there is only one chaotic orbit for each energy (Arnold-web hypothesis).

The usage of discrete frequencies to describe/proxy the frequency distrubition of an orbit/trajectory is perfectly okay for regular orbits, but dubious/inappropriate for stochastic orbits, which have a continuous frequency distribution. This is obvious, yet the authors only uncover it in section 4.3 as the origin of their alleged discrepancy between the rate of evolution of tidal debris and that of the "fundamental" frequencies of chaotic trajectories.

Can the frequency diffusion time be defined for continuous frequency distributions (without reference to sincle dominant frequencies)? And if so, would this time scale overcome the problem and obtain a correct indicator of the importance of chaos for the dispersion of tidal debris?

>>> 

Furthermore, the author's should explain/stress why the frequency distribution is relevant for the evolution of tidal debris. I think in the case of regular orbits this is essentially covered by Sanders & Binney (2013), but their analysis does not apply to chaotic orbits ...

>>> We are somewhat confused by this comment -- we agree that the relevance of the frequency distribution to the evolution of tidal debris is covered in Sanders & Binney (2013). This is also thoroughly covered in Helmi & White (1999) and is an intuitive way to understand the growth and evolution of tidal debris. These concepts are introduced in the beginning of Section 2.4, but in the text the reader is deferred to the above references for more details. 

minor comments:

The abstract should be shortened.

p4-9. More textbook references should be given for the basics reported in section 2.

>>> Added additional references to Arnold (1978), Goldstein (1980), Binney & Tremaine (2008).

p.5 The use of the letter 'i' in eq (4) is somewhat unfortunate/incorrect: it is used both as index and is sqrt(-1) and is missing as index of a_j (should be a_{ij}). Better use anothe letter (such as 'k' used in the following text).

>>> Thanks for catching this -- the equations have been updated.

p5. Does a set of frequencies really uniquely label a regular orbit? Isn't eq (5) creating some ambiguity here? Of course, the same issue pertains to the actions: one can always define a new set of actions by linearly combining the old set.

>>> A fair point -- we have removed the word "uniquely." 

p6. "The StŠckel or 'Perfect Ellipsoid' model" -- Every StŠckel potential is globally integrable (isn't even the reverse true: only StŠckel potentials are globally integrable?), but (I think) the perfect ellipsoid is the only StŠckel potential with ellipsoidal density contours and radially declining density. So better say simply "The 'Perfect Ellipsoid' model".

>>> Agreed -- I believe StŠckel potentials are the only *known* globally integrable, triaxial potentials. We have clarified this sentence to read:

...the `Perfect Ellipsoid' model (a special case of the StŠckel model; see, e.g., ...references).

p7. "Chaotic orbits ... despite ... deterministic". There is no spite: 'deterministic chaos' is well-known.

>>> We have changed the language in this sentence to read:

Chaotic orbits are generated by entirely deterministic equations of motion, yet exhibit random behavior.

p7. "Actions strictly do not exist for chaotic orbits" Why only "strictly"? Why "exists"? Actions describe tori, but chaotic orbits are not restricted to tori. The important point (missing in the text) is that a continuous set of tori filling a 5D volume (part of the respective energy hypersurface) is replaced by a single chaotic orbit.

>>> See response under next comment.

p7. "... frequency spectrum of [chaotic] orbits evolve ... with time". This is dubious/misleading. If defined for an infinite period, the frequency spectrum does not evolve (by definition) and if defined for a finite period, it is not the frequency spectrum of the orbit, but only of part of the orbit. Better to say that the intermittent frequency spectra on different parts of a chaotic orbit differ, such that any such spectrum measured over a finite period evolves (in a chaotic way).

>>> Thanks for these clarifications -- we have addressed the above two points by modifying the end of this paragraph to read:

Chaotic orbits are not bound to the surface of a torus and instead fill a (2N-1)-dimensional volume where a continuous set of tori would exist in an unperturbed Hamiltonian, $H_0$. While the frequency spectrum of sub-sections of a regular orbit are indistinguishable (i.e. measured over a finite interval of time), the frequency spectra of sub-sections of a chaotic orbit will evolve stochastically.

p7. What is meant by "... will drive orbits away from the resonance"? The resonance is only present in the unperturbed case. In the perturbed case, the resonant orbit (and its vicinity) is replaced by chaos, which doesn't satisfy any resonant condition (the frequency spectrum is not discrete...). In these discussions it should be stated that a "resonance" is first and foremost a resonance of the regular orbits (in the perturbed or unperturbed system), while in the perturbed system, only some regular orbits may retain the resonance.

>>> We have clarified this section of the paragraph to read:

If the resonance in the unperturbed Hamiltonian is unstable, all orbits associated with the resonance will be chaotic; unstable resonances form linear gaps in frequency-space (this is not shown in the cartoon). Thus, only some resonances in the perturbed system will retain the signature of a resonance.

p7. "Resonances overlap" is a sloppy/imprecise (though common) term. By definition, resonances cannot overlap. I think the authors meant the vicinity of the intersection of two (unperturbed) resonance lines. There is no overlap, though: the regions of regular orbits parented by different unperturbed resonant orbits don't overlap here: there is chaos instead.

>> Thanks for this clarification -- we have modified the text to read:

...especially in the vicinity of the intersection of two resonance lines (commonly referred to as `resonance overlap'; see Chirikov 1960).

p7. The term "conditionally-periodic" is unclear and not explained.

>>> We have replaced this term with "non-resonant".

p8. A strong argument in favour of large regions of regular orbits in real galaxies is their very existence: non-spherical galaxies cannot be sustained by chaotic orbits. A population made from chaotic orbits tends to be as round as the underlying potential, but the density must be more flattened.

p8. The 1st paragraph of 2.3 contains a contradiction "choatic orbits have no orbital actions" vs "chaotic diffucion of an orbit in actions" originating from confusing the orbital actions of the unperturbed system in the context of section 2.2 (eq 7). It's not clear what a "resonant layer" is -- the same as the "resonance lines of Fig.1?

p8. "chaotic motion across resonances" is again inconsistent: chaotic orbits cannot be resonant.

>>> This was sloppy terminology and we thank the referee for suggested improvements. We have modified this paragraph to instead read:

The orbits therefore do not have a single set of fundamental frequencies, but rather the frequencies that describe the character of motion evolve with time. In near-integrable potentials, the frequencies of consecutive sub-sections of a chaotic orbit diffuse both around resonance layers (a sort of stochastic libration) and along the stochastic layers that surround the resonances (Arnold diffusion). 

>>> We have additionally added a footnote to "around resonance layers" that reads:

Note that during this diffusion, the frequencies never exactly hit those of a KAM torus but evolve stochastically around these discrete, stable tori \citep[cf. Figure 2 in][]{laskar99}.

p8. I think what the authors should have said at the end of 2.3 is something like this: "If a stochastic trajectory is surrounded by regular orbits, it tends to stay close to ('trace') one of these orbits for many periods (and may appear near-regular), before switching to trace another regular ('lead') orbit, a process by which it may eventually sample the whole Arnold web. However, two initialy nearby stochastic trajectories may switch to different lead orbits at different times. This process is clearly important for the evolution of tidal debris."
Of course, this description of stochastic orbits applies only to weak chaos, when there are still plenty regular orbits working as 'obstacles' and 'leads'.

>>> This is cleaner terminology and we have adopted these terms in the revised paragraph:

If a stochastic trajectory is surrounded by regular orbits, it may appear similar to a nearby regular orbit (the `lead` orbit) over long periods of time before escaping to another such semi-bounded region where it will change in appearance to `trace' a new lead orbit (a process by which it may eventually explore the whole Arnold web). However, two initially nearby trajectories may switch to  different lead orbits at different times, a process which is clearly important for the evolution of tidal debris. Additionally, if the volume of the surrounded region (e.g., in frequency space) is comparable to the characteristic spread of frequencies in the tidal debris, this small-scale evolution will be important for tidal debris.

p11. "...contours of this potential in projection" --> "...contours of this potential"

>>> Fixed.

p11. Instead of (or in addition to) the potential contours in Fig.2, the authors should plot the density contours, which are much more familiar to most readers.

p11. "twisting inertia tensors" -- do the authors mean radially changing orientations of the semi axes? Such a system cannot be in equilibrium and hence must be evolving on its dynamical time scale ...

>>> We have changed this sentence to instead read:

...radially changing axis ratios or orientations...

and have moved the citation.

p12. A reference to Lyapunov should be given.

>>> A reference has been added.

p13. I commend the authors for publishing SuperFreq on GitHub.

>>> Thanks!

p13. It's not clear how the max is taken in eq (12). Is it R_k for which a_k is maximal or is there some weighting?

>>> It is the R_k for which a_k is maximal, as indicated by the sentence that follows Eq. 12:

"where the maximum is taken with respect to the corresponding amplitudes, $a_k$..."

If the referee thinks this needs further clarification please let us know.

p13. Is the "relevant time scale" really the that "over which the change in frequencies of a single orbit is comparable to the spread of frequencies in the ensemble"? What is so special about the frequency? Doesn't chaotic mixing/diffusion work even if the frequency diffusion is low? I'm also concerned about the definition of the latter in terms of only the dominant frequencies, rather than the full distribution.

>>> The point we are making is just that when the variation of the frequencies is on the same scale as the spread in frequencies of a set of orbits, then there should be an observable effect. We have clarified this statement by changing "the" to "a" as:

...a relevant timescale is the time...

p14. "Tube orbits are generally less stochastic than box orbits" and "there are appreciable numbers of stochastic tube orbits" -- this again are confusing/nonsensical statements. Tube and box orbits are regular, not stochastic. I think what the authors meant was that "when tracing tube orbits (appearing like a tube orbit) a chaotic orbits is locally less stochastic than when tracing box orbits (appearing like a box orbit)".

>>> We agree this was a misuse of these common terms. We have clarified this to read:

Chaotic orbits that trace tube orbits are generally less stochastic than chaotic orbits that trace box orbits, which tend to plunge deep into the inner regions of the potential where the density profile is steep.

p14. Perhaps in the context of section 4.1 and Fig.3, "trajectory" rather than "orbit" is the correct term. 10000 periods is long compared to the age of a stellar system, but (very) short compared to the Arnold web diffusion time.

Figs.4,5,10 The real structure of these figures may be fractal (at least in some places), which cannot, of course, be adequately represented with finite pixels. Perhaps, the authors could zoom in on a region where dark and white pixels are closely mixed?

I would be useful to also have the classible surface-of-section figures to describe the orbits A,B,C,D -- the sos plot should clearly separate regular from chaotic and show the degree of stochasticity.

p16. "all ensembles should start with the same initial spread in fundamental frequencies" -- this makes no sense for chaotic orbits, which have no fundamental frequencies (rather a continuous frequency distribution).

>>> We have removed this statement.

p17. How does Fig.7 change if the ensemble of points is restricted to the same energy surface? I suspect it makes little difference, but is this so?

>>> Tidal debris will not be restricted to an energy surface so we feel that our test is more relevant for the question at hand. We have remade Figure 4...

p17. 1024 periods is not long for chaotic orbits ...

>>> We have changed this to read:

...an integration period of 1024 orbital periods.

Fig.6 trajectory D is not strongly, but only mildly chaotic, since it has sharpish inner and outer edges (the sharp, infinite-density edges of regular orbits emerge from the projection of phase-space tori into configuration space and are a telltale of regularity). A strongly chaotic trajectory has blurred edges. I suspect, there is no stronly chaotic trajectory in this potential (at least not on the energy surface picked).

>>> We have added the word "more" before "strongly chaotic" to clarify in Section 4.2 and the caption for Figure 6.

Fig.9 The claims in the caption are unconvincing. What is clear is that orbits A and B decay like a power law, while orbits C and D decay faster.

p20. "The effect is especially significant ... of the Hamiltonian." -- Why is this so? Is this the Sanders & Binney (2013) argument?

>>> This is simply an argument about the variance of the frequency distribution. Since the variance orthogonal to the direction of largest spread must be much smaller, smaller deviations in this direction will be more significant / apparent.

p21. "Non-resonant orbits ... have thicker frequency distributions ..." is sloppy/slangy. In which sense thicker? Aren't the authors considering here the frequency distributions across an ensemble of nearby regular orbits (they don't say so)?

>>> We have changed "thicker frequency distributions" to read:

...will generically have frequency distributions that have more comparable spreads in each direction

Figs.12&13 suffer again from the unsuitablity of single fundamental frequencies to discribe a continuous spectrum.

Fig.14 is missing: the grey-scale map of the spread of frequencies for an ensemble of orbits around each orbit in Fig.4 ... If the author's argumentation is correct, it should closely match Fig.10, doesn't it? In fact, a plot of the frequency spread against the mean-density of debris ensembles may be worthwhile too.

TODO:
>>> There is no Figure 14?

p21. "fast chaotic diffusion of orbits" is sloppy/wrong: 1) chaos is a property of orbits, not an inter-orbit property; 2) diffusion does not apply to orbits, but (at best) to particles following orbits.

p23. In the list in section 5.2, the authors may want to add the wake(s) in the DM halo caused by satellites (LMC/SMC).

p24. "also possible also" ...

>>> Fixed.

p25. Who/what is the "Streeam Team"?
